- Move private types and functions into their own *Internal* modules
- Check perfect-vector-shuffle (currently blocked by base <= 4.9)
  for faster shuffling, but random-shuffle on list will do for now.
- Decide if we want to duplicate a shuffled deck in case players took all
the cards from deck.

Custom rules:
  - No need to signal `UNO` when the player left with one card.
  - Standard penalties doesn't exist.
  - Prohibit players to stack any cards except Skip card. (apparently official rule?)
  - Player can pull any amount of card they want from deck until they found 
  available matching card. 
    - There's no pick one card from deck and move on action.
